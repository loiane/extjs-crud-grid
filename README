Example of a CRUD grid using ExtJS and Spring Framework.

Libs used in this project:
Spring MVC Framework
JSON lib
ExtJS 3.1.1 - including RowEditor Plugin and Datadrop (ExtJS 3rd party plugin).

Also, this example demonstrates how to save data from a excel file
(take a look at http://github.com/loiane/extjs-grid-dragdrop-excel).

Download this example and run it in a java app server. (I used TomCat)
